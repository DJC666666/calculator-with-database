# Code Style Guide

## Introduction
This code style guide is derived from mainstream official standards and recommendations by major companies. The primary source for this code style guide is a combination of Microsoft's C# Coding Conventions and general software development best practices.

## Language
The code is written in C# and adheres to the C# language standards.

## Naming Conventions
- **Classes**: Use PascalCase for class names. Example: `frmCalculator`.
- **Methods**: Use PascalCase for method names. Example: `InputNumberOrOperator`.
- **Variables**: Use camelCase for variable names. Example: `memory`.
- **Constants**: Use uppercase with underscores for constants. Example: `CONNECTION_STRING`.

## Indentation and Spacing
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Place spaces around binary operators. Example: `if (txtDisplay.Text == "0")`.
- Put a space after the `//` for single-line comments.
- Use curly braces for blocks even if they contain a single statement.

## Comments
- Use comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious behavior.
- Include a comment header for classes and methods, describing their purpose.
- Use XML comments for documenting public methods and classes.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// This class represents the main calculator form.
/// </summary>
public partial class frmCalculator : Form
{
    // ...

    /// <summary>
    /// Clears the display and sets it to 0.
    /// </summary>
    private void btnClear_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

- Catch specific exceptions instead of using a generic `catch`.
- Provide meaningful error messages when handling exceptions.

```c#
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions.
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    MessageBox.Show("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

## Database Connections

- Use connection pooling for database connections.
- Ensure that database connections are properly closed or disposed of after use.
- Do not hardcode connection strings. Use configuration files or settings.

## Code Organization

- Separate sections of code with clear and concise comments.
- Keep related methods and properties together.
- Use regions sparingly and only for organization purposes.

## Code Documentation

- Document the code using XML comments for classes, methods, and properties.
- Document the purpose, parameters, and return values of methods and functions.

## Conclusion

This code style guide adheres to official standards and best practices in the industry. Following these guidelines will result in maintainable, readable, and reliable code.
